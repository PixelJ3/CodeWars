# My Awesome Project

CodeWars Daily Challenges

**Link to project:** https://github.com/PixelJ3/CodeWars

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

I do at least 1 CodeWars a day!

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.


NOTE:
  recent merge happened, so alot of the codewars were pushed 
  at the same time, this is because i wanted to have them in 
  a single folder and make it public
